So First step

1- Undertand Movet.NET How does it detect a pose?

2- Have diffeernt pose and make sure it says " pose1" for that pose.

3- Add some challenge, pose1 range time instead of static time. FOr example bending instead of just sitting. 

4- Had effect , need to learn where to do it . 


5- Had score ! Make it fun, if it is water pour it in specic things.. idk... will think of it later
